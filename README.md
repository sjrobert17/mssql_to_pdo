# mssql_to_pdo by Robert Doll
These functions replicate what the old php mssql functions did before being deprecated. 

I created these functions after attempting to find converters to move Wordpress to Microsoft SQL.
I found a "solution" that relied on the since deprecated mssql functions in php yet could not find a 
way to get them back. Although I did not look that far into this project seemed like a quick solution.
This is not a all inclusive package and has not been tested that much. It seems to work but use it at
your own risk.
